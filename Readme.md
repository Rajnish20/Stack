# Stack 

## Using Array
Im implementation of stack using array we have to define the size of array which is not a suitable method because this method does not work for large programming code.We get error when the array is full, the solution to this problem is that we have to define a new array of double the size of array of previous array and copy all the element but this method is rather time consuming and time complexity will be so high.

## Using Linked List
To overcome the problem which we faced in implementation of stack using array this concept is introduced where we dynamically allocating the size as per requirements using new operator.
